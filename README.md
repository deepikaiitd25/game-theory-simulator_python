# Game Theory Simulator in Python

A modular simulation framework for analyzing strategic behavior in classic 2-player games using evolutionary dynamics.

## Games Included
- Prisoner's Dilemma
- Matching Pennies
- Battle of the Sexes

##  Features
- One-shot and repeated game simulations
- Strategy tournaments (Tit-for-Tat, Grim Trigger, Always Defect, etc.)
- Replicator dynamics for population evolution with evolution plots
-
